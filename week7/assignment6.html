                <p>Jean Baudrillard writes “The Ecstasy of Communication” to critique the sociology of objects, 
                wherein the symbolic worth of an object begins to transcend its practical use. The “scene and mirror”, 
                where objects reflect their owner, has begun to give way to the “screen and network”, where communication 
                reigns supreme. Objects have begun to lose their psychological dimension, Baudrillard asserts; rather than 
                offering dreams and experiences, objects have lost their luster, becoming one more cog in a machine of 
                global interconnection. </p>

                <p>Rather than moving from a scene with objects to another scene, we move from one node to another, a 
                screen to a simulator, a smart fridge to a smart phone. Technological advancement has not only miniaturized 
                our devices, but also our experiences; everything needs to be more convenient, less downtime, higher speeds.
                Therefore, Baudrillard proclaims the scene dead, the little things in life left behind by screens and social 
                media. </p>
                    
                <p>The fact that I wasn’t able to get through this in one sitting has already proved Baudrillard’s point, to an extent; 
                multiple times as I was reading this I wished he would just get to the point already so I could move on. But even in 
                my less-than-full comprehension of the text, I could tell just how much Baudrillard had thought about this, how perfectly 
                he had encapsulated digital burnout years before the Internet found its way into mainstream use. The “delirium of communication” 
                that he describes in the last few passages is something I find especially interesting.</p>
                    
                <p>“I no longer succeed in knowing what I want, the space is so saturated, the pressure is so 
                great from all who want to make themselves heard.” (Baudrillard 132)</p>
                    
                <p>Baudrillard captures the feeling of overload that many experience today so succinctly that I was surprised to learn this essay was 
                published in 1987. Call it a paradox of choice, but sometimes I feel that the internet has made us too connected. I no longer ask where 
                to learn something, but what platform offers the best course on a topic; rather than look for news, I actively avoid it, as I know I’ll 
                find out the newest storm in politics one way or another; there are so many rip-offs and faulty products (accompanied by false reviews,
                no less) on Amazon that I often abandon it in favor of the supermarket. Often times, I wish I could look into a mirror rather than a screen.
