         <h3>Long Live the Web</h3>
         <p>
          I've never lived in a world without the Internet. In that sense, it's grown with
          me; it's almost like a childhood friend. That's why, when it changes, I think of it
          as part of the natural evolution that all things go through. However, in recent years,
          I've come to realize that change isn't always good, and this article puts that vague
          sense of dread into words for me.

          The first time I realized the Web as I knew it was under attack was during the Net
          Neutrality commotion a few years ago. The legislators and administratiors didn't see
          the Web as a resource as we did, but rather, a beast to be tamed. That's why I believe 
          in decentralized technologies such as blockchain and in personal web privacy, as they
          put some of that power back into the hands of the user.

         <h3>As We May Think</h3>
         <p>The fact that this article was written over half a century ago is fascinating
          and humbling; that the Internet was practically this man's dream, and that many
          of the same things that worried him still worry us today. Now, we've made technological
          advancement that Bush can only dream of, and reached a level of interconnectivity
          that makes sharing knowledge as he envisioned no longer a prospect, but reality.

          Reading articles like this remind me about how our current society is only possible
          due to the combined efforts of all those that came before us. Perhaps centuries before
          we had the internet, scientists and thinkers had been fantasizing about such things
          only held back by the contemporary advancements in technology.
